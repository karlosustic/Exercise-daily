// Task 1 - studlyCapVar should be defined and have a value of 10.
// Task 2 - properCamelCase should be defined and have a value of the string A String.
// Task 3 - titleCaseOver should be defined and have a value of 9000.
// Task 4 - studlyCapVar should use camelCase in both declaration and assignment sections.
// Task 5 - properCamelCase should use camelCase in both declaration and assignment sections.
// Task 6 - titleCaseOver should use camelCase in both declaration and assignment sections.

Correct incorrectly written variables

// Variable declarations
var studlyCapVar;
var properCamelCase;
var titleCaseOver;

// Variable assignments
studlyCapVar = 10;
properCamelCase = "A String";
titleCaseOver = 9000;

Solution:

// Variable declarations
var studlyCapVar;
var properCamelCase;
var titleCaseOver;

// Variable assignments
studlyCapVar = 10;
properCamelCase = "A String";
titleCaseOver = 9000;
